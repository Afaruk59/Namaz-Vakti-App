# Book Feature Refactoring

This document outlines the refactoring process for the Book feature in the Kitap Oku app.

## Goals

1. Reduce the line count of the `book_page_screen.dart` file
2. Improve code maintainability and organization
3. Make the code more testable
4. Preserve functionality and visual appearance

## Architecture Approach

The refactoring follows a Controller-based architecture where separate controllers are responsible for specific functionality domains. This approach:

- Separates concerns
- Reduces coupling
- Makes the code more maintainable
- Facilitates testing

## Controllers

### BookPageController
Manages page loading, navigation, and state:
- Page loading and caching
- Page navigation (next, previous, jump to page)
- Tracking current page and page state

### BookAudioController
Handles all audio-related functionality:
- Audio playback (play, pause, seek)
- Audio state management
- Audio preferences

### BookBookmarkController
Manages bookmarks and highlights:
- Adding/removing bookmarks
- Checking bookmark status
- Managing bookmark collections

### BookThemeController
Controls visual appearance settings:
- Font size management
- Background color settings
- Auto background mode

### BookMediaController
Handles media controls for lock screen:
- Media metadata
- Lock screen controls
- Page information for media controls

### BookNavigationController
Coordinates navigation between pages:
- Page transitions
- Audio state during navigation
- Bookmark updates during navigation

### BookUIComponentsManager
Manages all UI components:
- AppBar rendering
- Bookmark button
- Page content
- Bottom bar
- Drawer

## Implementation

1. Created controller classes with specific responsibilities
2. Modified the main `BookPageScreen` class to use these controllers
3. Created a new `book_page_screen_refactored.dart` that demonstrates the new architecture
4. Maintained backward compatibility during refactoring

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Line Count**: The main screen file is now significantly smaller
2. **Better Organization**: Each controller handles a specific domain
3. **Improved Testability**: Controllers can be tested in isolation
4. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify specific functionality

## Future Improvements

1. Complete migration from legacy managers to controllers
2. Add unit tests for controllers
3. Further reduce UI complexity by extracting more components
4. Implement dependency injection for better testability
